## Introduction

This open source **OpenCV demonstrator (GUI)**, originally developped by
[TSD Conseil](http://www.tsdconseil.fr), is now through this GitHub
repository opened to user contributions. With the help of the OpenCV
community we can make a very exciting product!

Screenshots and stable binary releases are available on the
[official OpenCV demonstrator web page](http://www.tsdconseil.fr/log/opencv/demo/index-en.html).


## Pre-built binaries

If you just want to try OpenCV without having to write any line of code, or if
you want to just test the OpenCV demonstrator, you can simply download and
install the lastest stable binary package, which can be found on the
[OpenCV demonstrator web page](http://www.tsdconseil.fr/log/opencv/demo/index-en.html)
(for now only Windows binary installer is available, but a `.deb` should be
available soon).


## Build from source

If you want to build the demonstrator from the source code, please follow the
build instructions that are located in the file
[doc/build-instructions.md](doc/build-instructions.md).


## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you wish to add your own demonstration, please
have a look to the
[tutorial for adding a new demonstration item](doc/tutorial-new-demo.md).


## Road map

- clean up source code
- write detailed and thorough build instructions for Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX
- create separate build targets for Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX
- provide `deb` and `rpm` installation packages for Linux distributions
- provide a `brew` installation package for Mac OSX
- improve i18n support (switch to full UTF-8)
- add Russian translations
- better documentation
- increase coverage of OpenCV functions
- tests
- GUI improvements (multiple filters, scripting support, etc.)
