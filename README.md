## Introduction

The original **OpenCV demonstrator (GUI)** was written by Julien A. (www.tsdconseil.fr), and released at
[TSD Conseil](http://www.tsdconseil.fr/log/opencv/demo/index-en.html). This GitHub repository was created
from the original source code. The purpose of this GitHub repository is to enable open source contributions
for the original **OpenCV demonstrator (GUI)**. With the help of the OpenCV community we can make a very
exciting product!


## Setup

Te build instruction are located in the file [doc/build-instructions.md](doc/build-instructions.md). In the near future,
more detailed and thorough instructions will be written.


## Road map

- clean up source code
- write detailed and thorough build instructions for Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX
- create separate build targets for Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX
- provide `deb` and `rpm` installation packages for Linux distributions
- provide a `brew` installation package for Mac OSX
- improve i18n support (switch to full UTF-8)
- add Russian translations
- better documentation
- increase coverage of OpenCV functions
- tests
- GUI improvements (multiple filters, scripting support, etc.)
