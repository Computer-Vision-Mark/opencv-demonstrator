# Coding style rules

This document describe the coding rules to be applied in the project, so as to oreserve coherency.

## C++ coding rules

 - Indentation: no tabulations, only spaces, and 2 spaces by indentation level.
 - All variables, functions, member functions and variables, should be written in lowercase letters, and if an object name is made of several words, these should be seperated by the `_` letter. For instance: `variable_1`, `my_function`.
 - All classes and structures names should be written according to the "CamelCase" convention (first letter in uppercase, seperation by the uppercase)
   

Other rules may be added in the future.

Any suggestion welcome!
