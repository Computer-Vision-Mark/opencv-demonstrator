# Coding style rules

This document describe the coding rules to be applied in the project, so as to preserve coherency.

## C++ coding rules

 - Documentation: [Doxygen format] (http://www.doxygen.org)
 - Indentation: no tabulations, only spaces, and 2 spaces by indentation level.
 - All variables, functions, member functions and variables, should be written in lowercase letters, and if an object name is made of several words, these should be seperated by the `_` symbol. For instance: `variable_1`, `my_function`.
 - All classes and structures names should be written according to the "CamelCase" convention (first letter in uppercase, seperation by the uppercase)
 - All files should be named in lowercase letters, with the different words separated by a `-` symbol.

 - All text based files to utf-8, and Unix style line endings. Unix uses just line feed ("\n"). 
    1.  [See issue #5] (https://github.com/tsdconseil/opencv-demonstrator/issues/5)
    2.  See also [Github's advice] (https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings/)
    3.  Note also the file .gitattributes in the root directory.

 - Validate XML files.
