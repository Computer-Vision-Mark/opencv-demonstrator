# Coding style rules

This document describe the coding rules to be applied in the project, so as to preserve coherency.

## C++ coding rules

 - Documentation: Doxygen format (see [http://www.doxygen.org(http://www.doxygen.org))
 - Indentation: no tabulations, only spaces, and 2 spaces by indentation level.
 - All variables, functions, member functions and variables, should be written in lowercase letters, and if an object name is made of several words, these should be seperated by the `_` symbol. For instance: `variable_1`, `my_function`.
 - All classes and structures names should be written according to the "CamelCase" convention (first letter in uppercase, seperation by the uppercase)
 - All files should be named in lowercase letters, with the different words separated by a `-` symbol.


Other rules may be added in the future.

Any suggestion welcome!
